This repository contains data and analysis supporting the publication "The loader complex Scc2/4 forms co-condensates with DNA as loading sites for cohesin"

Content: 
- Videos of droplet microscopy and function for background correction
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis of DNA compaction, exemplary videos of DNA compaction by Scc2/4
- Analysis of cohesin binding behavior, exemplary video of cohesin recruitment to condensates
- Force extension curves for the first stretch and relax cycle of lambda DNA tethers after incubation with 10 nM Scc2/4
- Transient force response of lambda DNA tethers before, during and after incubation with 10 nM Scc2/4
